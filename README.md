I'm just leaving a quick note here. You have some functionality with a folder called "transcrips".
I didn't have the folder so i couldn't confirm your part of the code (I renamed it stats, I hope that's okay).
If you try and run the stuff in Complete.ipnyb it'll fail cuz it's all running on the upgraded openAI
We can meet before submission and we can test it on my computer once I copy the files over. That way it's all sitting on one machine. Worst case scenario is that I show the generation, single process, and folder process on mine, and you can show the call stats on yours.
