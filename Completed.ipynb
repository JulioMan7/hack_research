    "            ## Context\n",
    "                You will generate a full script for a phone call to a call center for a health system called RGV Health.RGV Health is part of a minority serving health system. Many phone calls represent issues that plauge these minority communities.\n",
    "            ## Task\n",
    "                You are creating training data based on full phone conversations. Your data will be converted to spoken word and used to help train AI models and humans. Be sure to follow the guidelines in order to provide a smooth collection of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "            ## Guidelines for Synthetic Transcript Generation\n",
    "                The phone call should include the following information naturally:\n",
    "                    - name of patient\n",
    "                    - name of caller (if different than patient such as calling for a child)\n",
    "                    - identity of caller {ident0}\n",
    "                    - reason for calling: {reason0}\n",
    "                    - appointment scheduled: {sched0}\n",
    "                    - if appointment is not able to be scheduled, give a valid reasoning\n",
    "                The phone call should only include spoken words and no tags such as [pauses] [holds] [hold music] or [end of conversation]. Since this will be turned to speech, such tags will hinder data collection. \n",
    "    \n",
    "                You should generate both the caller and the agent taking the phone call. Your goal is to output the entire synthetic conversation. \n",
    "\n",
    "            ## Output\n",
    "                Your output should follow a structured format:\n",
    "                    -Either the caller or answering agent can begin the conversation, but it should not be indicated which is speaking.\n",
    "                    -The entire conversation should be in a single output. \n",
    "                    -The entire conversation can be supplied within strings to separate speakers.\n",
    "                Example:\n",
    "                \"Hello, I would like to schedule an appointment for next week.\"\n",
    "                \"Sure, we at RGV Health would be happy to help make an appointment for you. Can I get your name and date of birth?\"\n",
